## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Security first: Production deployments at risk, hardening before refactoring
- Refactor after bugs: Stabilize behavior before restructuring
- LRU over hard limits: Graceful degradation preferred
- 01-01: 10s window, 5 errors max for rate-limited logging (SEC-04)
- 01-01: Only log errorCode, not full error object to prevent log bloat
- 01-02: Separate utility file for JWT validation (clean separation, testable)
- 01-02: Config secret takes precedence over env secret
- 01-02: Error messages include openssl generation hint
- 01-03: Instance maxDriftMs replaces static MAX_DRIFT for configurability
- 01-03: Strict mode throws detailed error with drift value and threshold
- 01-03: Default strictMode=false preserves backwards compatibility
- 02-01: Worker scripts compile to CJS only (required by worker_threads)
- 02-01: Jest warns but does not fail when worker scripts missing
- 02-01: Multi-config tsup pattern for separate build targets

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Known fragile areas (from CONCERNS.md):
- ClusterMessage type union (30+ message types) - affects Phase 4
- IndexedLWWMap/IndexedORMap complexity - avoid touching during refactors
- Storage loading race conditions - related to BUG-05
