## Decisions

| Date | Specification | Decision |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 2026-01-23 | SPEC-001 | MessageRegistry pattern for routing CLIENT_OP and OP_BATCH to handlers |
| 2026-01-24 | SPEC-002 | PollOptions pattern for bounded test polling (timeoutMs, intervalMs, maxIterations, description) |
| 2026-01-25 | PRE-001 | Handler extraction pattern for ServerCoordinator reduction (BroadcastHandler, GCHandler, ClusterEventHandler) |
| 2026-01-25 | SPEC-003 | Split SPEC-003 into 4 parts: SPEC-003a (BroadcastHandler), SPEC-003b (GCHandler), SPEC-003c (ClusterEventHandler), SPEC-003d (Additional Handlers) |
| 2026-01-25 | SPEC-003a | BroadcastHandler extraction pattern with Config-based DI and delegation from ServerCoordinator |
| 2026-01-25 | SPEC-003b | GCHandler extraction approved - follows established handler pattern with distributed consensus |
| 2026-01-25 | SPEC-003c | ClusterEventHandler extraction approved - routes 16 cluster message types with callback pattern |
| 2026-01-26 | SPEC-003c | ClusterEventHandler implementation approved - all 16 message types correctly routed, 187 lines removed from ServerCoordinator |
| 2026-01-27 | SPEC-003d | Extract 7 additional handlers (HeartbeatHandler, QueryConversionHandler, BatchProcessingHandler, WriteConcernHandler, ClientMessageHandler, PersistenceHandler, OperationContextHandler) - all methods verified, ~948 lines total |
| 2026-01-27 | SPEC-003d | APPROVED: All 7 handlers extracted successfully (720 lines removed, 22.8% reduction). ServerCoordinator reduced from 3163 to 2443 lines. Target was <2300 (6.2% over), but acceptable due to delegation overhead and core coordination logic. |

## Project Patterns

- Monorepo with package hierarchy: core -> client/server -> adapters/react
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Commit format: `type(scope): description`
- CRDTs use Hybrid Logical Clocks for causality tracking
- Handler extraction pattern: separate message handlers into focused modules with config injection
- Test polling pattern: use centralized test-helpers.ts with PollOptions for bounded iterations

## Warnings

None - all active warnings resolved.
