## Project Patterns

- Monorepo with package hierarchy: core -> client/server -> adapters/react
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Commit format: `type(scope): description`
- CRDTs use Hybrid Logical Clocks for causality tracking
- Handler extraction pattern: separate message handlers into focused modules with config injection
- Test polling pattern: use centralized test-helpers.ts with PollOptions for bounded iterations
- Late binding pattern: handlers can receive callbacks after construction via setXxxCallbacks methods
- Test harness pattern: ServerTestHarness provides controlled access to internal handlers for tests
- Timer cleanup pattern: handlers with timers implement stop() method, called by LifecycleManager during shutdown
- Message routing pattern: MessageRouter provides declarative type-based routing for server messages
- Module factory pattern: each domain gets its own factory function with explicit dependency injection
- Deferred startup pattern: module factories create resources but do not bind ports; start() method called after assembly
- Domain grouping pattern: handlers grouped by domain (CRDT, Sync, Query, Messaging, etc.) for Actor Model portability
- Client message handler pattern: ClientMessageHandlers module registers all client-side message types via registerClientMessageHandlers()
- React hook testing pattern: use renderHook + act from @testing-library/react with mock client wrapped in TopGunProvider
- Schema domain splitting pattern: organize schemas by domain (base, sync, query, search, cluster, messaging) with barrel re-exports
- DST infrastructure pattern: VirtualClock/SeededRNG/VirtualNetwork for deterministic simulation testing; injectable ClockSource via HLC for reproducible time
- HTTP sync transport pattern: HttpSyncProvider implements IConnectionProvider via message type routing in send(); AutoConnectionProvider provides WS-to-HTTP fallback; server uses setHttpRequestHandler() deferred wiring for POST /sync
- VM sandbox pattern: ProcessorSandbox fallback uses vm.Script + runInNewContext({ timeout }) for synchronous code interruption; isolated-vm primary path unchanged
- IConnection adapter pattern: IConnectionProvider returns IConnection interface (send/close/readyState) instead of concrete WebSocket; WebSocketConnection wraps WS, HttpConnection wraps HTTP queue; ConnectionReadyState constants avoid WebSocket global dependency
- Partition pruning pattern: PartitionService.getRelevantPartitions extracts key predicates (_key, key, id, _id) from queries to prune distributed fan-out; targetedNodes on DistributedSubscription keeps checkAcksComplete consistent with pruned node sets
- Node ID reconciliation pattern: ConnectionPool.addNode() matches incoming server-assigned nodeId against existing seed connections by endpoint; remapNodeId() transfers NodeConnection entry preserving WebSocket/state/pending; node:remapped event notifies ClusterClient and PartitionRouter
- Batch delegation pattern: IConnectionProvider.sendBatch is optional; SyncEngine delegates to it when available (cluster mode) for per-key partition routing; falls back to single OP_BATCH in single-server mode
- Double-option deserialization pattern: For Rust fields matching TS `.nullable().optional()`, use `Option<Option<T>>` with custom `deserialize_double_option` to distinguish absent (None) from explicitly-null (Some(None))
- Float64 numeric interop pattern: JavaScript's msgpackr encodes numbers > 2^32 as float64; use `serde_number::deserialize_u64` (from `hlc::serde_number`) on Rust u64/i64 fields to accept both integer and float64 MsgPack wire values
