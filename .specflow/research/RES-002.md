# Research: Competitive Product Positioning

## Summary

TopGun occupies a unique position at the intersection of two traditionally separate markets: server-side in-memory data grids (Hazelcast) and client-side offline-first sync engines (PowerSync, ElectricSQL). No existing product successfully bridges both worlds with a unified architecture. The closest competitors overlap partially -- Hazelcast dominates backend distributed computing but has no browser presence; PowerSync/ElectricSQL excel at client-to-database sync but lack server-side compute and distributed data structures. TopGun's CRDT-based local-first model combined with server-side clustering creates a genuinely novel category.

## Background

This research was conducted to understand TopGun's competitive landscape across two overlapping markets and to inform strategic product positioning. The analysis covers nine products across three categories: enterprise in-memory data grids, offline-first sync engines, and collaborative/real-time databases.

---

## Part 1: Deep Analysis -- Hazelcast

### Overview

Hazelcast is a unified real-time data platform combining an in-memory data store with a stream processing engine. Founded in 2008, it is the most established in-memory data grid (IMDG) and serves enterprise customers in financial services, telecom, and logistics.

### Architecture

- **Peer-to-peer cluster**: No master node. Each member is functionally identical.
- **Partitioning**: Data is evenly distributed across cluster members with automatic rebalancing on failure.
- **Backups**: Configurable backup count per partition (default 1). Backups are distributed across nodes.
- **Near Cache**: Client-side read caching that creates a local copy of frequently accessed map data, with invalidation when the source data changes.
- **Jet Engine**: Integrated stream processing engine that can aggregate 10M events/sec per node with sub-10ms latency.

### Key Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Distributed Maps** | Partitioned key-value store (IMap). Supports queries, indexes, entry processors. |
| **Distributed Queues** | Producer-consumer pattern with persistent backing. |
| **Topics** | Cluster-wide pub/sub with ordered delivery (ITopic, ReliableTopic). |
| **SQL Engine** | Apache Calcite-based SQL that compiles to Jet execution graphs. Currently limited to Map queries. |
| **Jet Streaming** | Batch and stream processing. Event-time semantics, windowing, fault-tolerant snapshots. |
| **ExecutorService** | Distributed task execution across cluster members. |
| **Locks & Semaphores** | Distributed concurrency primitives. |
| **Entry Processors** | Server-side in-place mutations (avoids serialization round-trip). |

### Client Libraries

| Language | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Java | Primary (same codebase as server) |
| .NET | Full client |
| Python | Full client |
| Node.js | Full client (server-side only) |
| Go | Full client |
| C++ | Full client (C++11 required) |
| **Browser/Frontend** | **NOT SUPPORTED** |

**Critical limitation**: Hazelcast has **no browser client**. The Node.js client uses raw TCP sockets and is designed exclusively for server-side use. The official recommendation is to keep the Hazelcast client on the server and expose a restricted REST/WebSocket API to the browser. This is a fundamental architectural constraint -- Hazelcast was never designed for client-side or offline-first use.

### Data Model & Schema

- Schema-less key-value model (maps store serialized objects).
- No client-side schema management.
- Supports JSON values, portable serialization, and compact serialization.
- Indexes can be defined on map attributes for query optimization.
- No CRDT support; relies on distributed locking and entry processors for consistency.

### Pricing & Licensing

| Edition | License | Cost |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Community** | Apache 2.0 + Hazelcast Community License | Free |
| **Enterprise (Self-Managed)** | Commercial | Annual subscription (contact sales) |
| **Cloud (Managed)** | Pay-as-you-go | Per GB of memory per hour |

Open-core model: Community edition has core data store and streaming. Enterprise adds security (TLS, encryption at rest, RBAC), WAN replication, hot restart persistence, blue-green deployments, and advanced monitoring.

### Typical Use Cases

- **Session caching** (web applications)
- **Distributed caching layer** (reduce database load)
- **Real-time fraud detection** (financial services)
- **Payment processing** (sub-millisecond card authorization)
- **IoT event processing** (telecom, logistics)
- **OLTP/OLAP** on hot data

### Target Audience

Enterprise Java shops. Predominantly backend engineers at large organizations (banks, telecoms, e-commerce platforms) who need sub-millisecond latency on server-side data.

### Strengths

- Battle-tested at massive scale (millions of ops/sec)
- Rich distributed primitives (maps, queues, locks, compute)
- Unified data store + stream processing in one platform
- Masterless architecture with automatic failover
- Mature ecosystem and enterprise support

### Weaknesses

- **No browser/frontend client** -- cannot reach end users directly
- **No offline-first capability** -- requires network connectivity
- **No CRDT support** -- uses distributed locking (not suitable for disconnected operation)
- **Java-centric** -- server written in Java; non-Java clients are thin wrappers
- **Complex operational model** -- requires cluster management expertise
- **No client-side data model** -- no local persistence or sync

---

## Part 2: Deep Analysis -- PowerSync

### Overview

PowerSync is a sync engine that keeps backend databases in sync with on-device SQLite databases. It enables offline-first applications with a server-authoritative architecture. Acquired by JourneyApps, it has strong traction in mobile enterprise apps.

### Architecture

- **Server-authoritative**: Backend database (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL) is the source of truth.
- **Sync Service**: PowerSync Cloud or self-hosted service manages bi-directional sync.
- **Client-side SQLite**: On-device SQLite database for local reads/writes.
- **Sync Rules**: Declarative rules controlling which data syncs to which users (being replaced by Sync Streams).
- **Checkpoint-based**: Uses checkpoints to guarantee consistency and track sync progress.

### Key Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Client-side SQLite** | Full SQL query capability on device. |
| **Sync Rules** | Server-defined rules for partial replication per user. |
| **Offline persistence** | Local SQLite survives app restart. |
| **Real-time sync** | WebSocket-based live streaming of changes. |
| **Backend agnostic** | Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server. |
| **Schema management** | Client-side schema applied via SQLite views over schemaless sync data. No migrations needed. |

### Client Libraries

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| React / React Native | Full SDK |
| Flutter / Dart | Full SDK |
| Kotlin (Android) | Full SDK |
| Swift (iOS) | Full SDK |
| Web (JavaScript) | Full SDK |

### Conflict Resolution

- **Default**: Last-write-wins; deletes always win.
- **Custom**: Developer implements conflict resolution logic in their backend API.
- **Change tracking**: Optional pattern where client writes change rows; server processes them sequentially.
- **Manual resolution**: Conflicts can be surfaced to users for manual resolution.
- Server is always authoritative -- whatever is written to backend DB is synced to all clients.

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Key Limits |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Free** | $0/mo | 2 GB sync/mo, 500 MB hosted, 50 connections. Deactivated after 1 week inactivity. |
| **Pro** | From $49/mo | 30 GB sync included, 1K connections, email support. |
| **Team** | From $599/mo | SLA support, SOC 2 & HIPAA, VPC peering. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 24/7 support, dedicated success engineer. |
| **Self-Hosted (Open)** | Free | Source-available, core features. |
| **Self-Hosted (Enterprise)** | Custom | Premium support + compliance. |

### Typical Use Cases

- Field service apps (construction, utilities)
- Mobile enterprise apps with unreliable connectivity
- Inventory management
- Healthcare data collection
- Any app needing offline-first with existing Postgres/MongoDB backend

### Target Audience

Mobile and web developers building offline-capable applications on top of existing relational databases. Strong in enterprise mobile.

### Strengths

- Plugs into existing database infrastructure (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL)
- Mature client SDKs across all mobile platforms
- Client-side SQL queries (familiar, powerful)
- Schemaless sync protocol eliminates client-side migrations
- SOC 2, HIPAA compliance options

### Weaknesses

- **No server-side compute** -- pure sync layer, no distributed processing
- **No CRDTs** -- conflict resolution is application-level, not automatic
- **No distributed data structures** -- no maps, queues, topics
- **Sync-only architecture** -- cannot process or transform data server-side
- **Backend coupling** -- requires a backend database and API layer
- **No peer-to-peer sync** -- always through central server

## Part 4: Key Questions Answered

### Q1: Where does the IMDG market overlap with the offline-first sync market?

These two markets have historically been **completely separate** with different customers, use cases, and architectures:

| Aspect | IMDG (Hazelcast, Ignite, GridGain) | Offline-First Sync (PowerSync, Electric, Replicache) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary user** | Backend/infrastructure engineers | Frontend/mobile developers |
| **Data location** | Server-side cluster RAM | Client-side device storage |
| **Network assumption** | Always connected (data center) | Intermittent/offline |
| **Consistency model** | Strong consistency (CP) | Eventual consistency (AP) |
| **Conflict resolution** | Distributed locking | CRDTs or application-level |
| **Query model** | Server-side SQL/predicates | Client-side SQLite/JS queries |
| **Scale dimension** | Horizontal cluster scaling | Number of client devices |
| **Pricing model** | Per GB of cluster RAM | Per sync volume / MAU |

**The overlap exists in the "Near Cache" concept**: Hazelcast's Near Cache creates a local read-only copy of server data on the client (Node.js process), similar to how sync engines maintain local copies. However, Near Cache is:
- Read-only (no offline writes)
- Server-process only (not browser)
- Not persisted (lost on restart)
- Not CRDT-based (invalidation model)

### Q2: Is there a product that bridges both worlds?

**No.** No existing product successfully combines:
1. Server-side distributed computing (partitioning, compute, streaming)
2. Client-side offline-first with CRDT conflict resolution
3. Seamless sync between the two

The closest attempts:
- **Ditto** has peer-to-peer mesh + cloud sync, but no server-side compute or distributed data structures
- **Convex** has server-side functions + reactive client updates, but is not truly offline-first
- **RxDB** has maximum client flexibility, but provides no server component at all
- **Hazelcast** has maximum server capability, but cannot reach browsers

**TopGun is uniquely positioned** to bridge this gap with:
- Client-side CRDTs (LWWMap, ORMap) for offline-first writes
- Server-side cluster with partitioning (271 partitions) for distributed storage
- WebSocket sync with MerkleTree delta reconciliation
- HLC-based causality tracking across all nodes (client and server)

### Q3: What are the emerging trends?

1. **Sync engines as infrastructure** -- the industry is moving from "fetch data" to "sync data." TanStack DB (2025) + ElectricSQL Postgres Sync represent this trend.

2. **Local-first going mainstream** -- FOSDEM 2026 has a dedicated "Local-First, Sync Engines, CRDTs" track. Multiple Y Combinator-backed startups in this space.

3. **CRDT adoption accelerating** -- Even non-CRDT products (Convex, PowerSync) are adding CRDT integration points. Liveblocks chose Yjs CRDTs for their storage engine.

4. **Database-agnostic sync** -- PowerSync expanding from Postgres to MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server. ElectricSQL remains Postgres-only.

5. **Edge computing convergence** -- IMDGs moving toward edge deployment. Ditto raised $82M for edge sync. The boundary between "server" and "client" is blurring.

6. **AI integration** -- Convex has built-in RAG. Liveblocks has AI agent collaboration. AI workloads need fast local data access.

7. **Open source as table stakes** -- Convex open-sourced (Feb 2025). ElectricSQL is Apache 2.0. RxDB core is Apache 2.0. Closed-source sync engines are losing mindshare.

### Q4: How important is client-side schema management?

**Critical for adoption, but approaches vary dramatically:**

| Product | Schema Approach | Migration Strategy |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **PowerSync** | Client-defined schema over schemaless sync data (SQLite views). | No migrations needed -- schemaless protocol handles evolution. |
| **ElectricSQL** | Server-defined (Postgres DDL propagates to clients). | Postgres migrations propagate automatically. |
| **Convex** | TypeScript schema definitions with auto-generated types. | Schema push with validation. |
| **RxDB** | JSON Schema with version numbers. | Incremental migration functions per version. |
| **InstantDB** | Schemaless (triple store). | No schema, no migrations. |
| **TopGun** | Zod schemas in core package. LWWMap/ORMap are schemaless at the CRDT level. | Currently no formal migration system. |

**Key insight**: The most successful products either go fully schemaless (InstantDB, PowerSync's sync layer) or make schema management nearly invisible (Convex's TypeScript-first approach). Requiring developers to manage schema migrations on the client side is a significant friction point.

## Part 6: Recommendations for TopGun Positioning

### Primary Positioning

**"The hybrid data grid: server-side power meets client-side offline-first."**

TopGun should NOT position against individual competitors but instead define a new category that combines:
1. **From the IMDG world**: Distributed maps, topics, server-side partitioning, cluster coordination
2. **From the offline-first world**: Client-side CRDTs, local persistence, zero-latency reads, real-time sync

### Competitive Advantages to Emphasize

1. **Only product with both browser CRDTs AND server clustering** -- no competitor has this combination.
2. **Zero-latency reads everywhere** -- like Hazelcast's Near Cache but with CRDT writes and offline persistence.
3. **No backend database required for sync** -- unlike PowerSync/ElectricSQL which need Postgres. TopGun IS the database.
4. **Automatic conflict resolution** -- unlike PowerSync's manual approach. LWWMap and ORMap resolve deterministically.
5. **TypeScript-native** -- unlike Hazelcast (Java) or Ditto (Rust/C++). Same language client and server.

### Key Differentiators to Build

Based on this competitive analysis, the following capabilities would strengthen TopGun's unique position:

1. **Client-side schema management** -- Consider PowerSync's schemaless sync + client-side views approach or Convex's TypeScript-first schema approach. Current Zod schemas are a good foundation.
2. **Distributed compute API** -- Entry processors or server-side functions (like Hazelcast's ExecutorService or Convex's server functions) would fill the gap between pure sync and full compute.
3. **SQL query layer** (post-Rust migration) -- Even limited SQL support would attract the Hazelcast/PowerSync audience.
4. **Partial replication / shapes** -- ElectricSQL's "shapes" concept for syncing only relevant data subsets is becoming table stakes.

### Risks to Monitor

1. **ElectricSQL + TanStack DB** integration could create a compelling open-source stack that covers much of TopGun's client-side value prop.
2. **Convex offline improvements** could make it a serious hybrid competitor.
3. **Ditto's $82M funding** means they could expand into web/browser territory.
4. **Hazelcast adding a browser client** would be the most direct competitive threat, though their architecture makes this unlikely.
